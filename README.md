# Business Details
It is an app where user can provide review for hotels. The business revolves around our personal contacts with food critics whose review comments and ratings are highly valued.
The application login is on invite-only basis to food critics.
Currently we have a venture capitalist investment, but with no income.
The future of the business lies in attracting hotels once we have a successful database of reviews and ratings. These hotels would publish ads on our website in the future, and we shall thus earn revenue.

* So, there are 2 very critical assets for the business today:
	1. The fund from the venture capitalist
	2. The current database and relationship with food critics
